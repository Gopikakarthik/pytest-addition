# DATE:25/10/24
# REGISTER NUMBER:212222040046
### Aim:
To write a python program for addition of two numbers and test the test cases using Pytest.
### Algorithm:
Step 1: Write the python program for addition of two numbers. 
Step 2: Make sure that function
name should be “def test_*():” and the line to be tested should have assert keyword at the
beginning. 
Step 3: Write some test cases for to be tested and save it as “test_add.py”.
Step 4: Open command prompt and change the directory to where pytest and program is saved and type “pytest
test_add.py” and run it. 
Step 5: Stop the program
### Program:
```
def add(a,b):
return a+b
def test_3_plus_5_equals_8():
assert add(3,5) == 8
def test_2_plus_3_equals_5():
assert add(2,3) ==
```
### Output:

### Result:
Thus,the python program for addition is tested using pytest and executed and output is verified
successfully.
